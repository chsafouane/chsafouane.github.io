    "\n",
    "#### The header\n",
    "\n",
    "The header of a PDF file tells you about the PDF specifications version used to generate it. It is always the first line of the file and starts with the `%PDF-` marker. In Figure 1, it corresponds to `%PDF-1.7`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The body\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, the body is where you define the content of the PDF. Everything that you see when you open a PDF - the text you read, the images you view, the fonts that make the text look pretty - all of this is generated from the \"objects\" defined in the body.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think about when you open a PDF and scroll through it. You might see different pages, each with its own layout, fonts, and content. Behind the scenes, each of these elements is stored as a separate object in the PDF body.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you look at the PDF file in the gist, you'll see that it contains 5 objects. Each object in a PDF is identified by a unique object number and a generation number (usually 0 for new objects).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The cross-reference table\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, here's where the magic happens that makes PDFs so fast to navigate. You know how you can instantly jump to page 50 of a 200-page PDF, or how quickly a PDF opens even when it's a large file? That's thanks to the cross-reference table (or \"xref table\").\n",
    "\n",
    "The xref table maps object numbers to their byte positions in the file. Here's the one from our sample PDF:\n",
    "\n",
    "```pdf\n",
    "xref\n",
    "0 6\n",
    "0000000000 65535 f \n",
    "0000000017 00000 n \n",
    "0000000070 00000 n \n",
    "0000000126 00000 n \n",
    "0000000281 00000 n \n",
    "0000000385 00000 n \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me break this down:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `xref` marks the start of the cross-reference table\n",
    "- `0 6` means this section covers 6 objects starting from object 0\n",
    "- Each line has three parts: `byte_offset generation_number n/f`\n",
    "  - **Byte offset**: The exact position in the file where the object starts (like a street address)\n",
    "  - **Generation number**: Usually 0 for active objects\n",
    "  - **n/f flag**: `n` means the object is in use, `f` means it's free (deleted)\n",
    "\n",
    "The generation number and the n/f flag are useful when the PDF is modified.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, when you want to see the page content, the PDF reader looks up object 4 (content stream) in this table, sees it at byte position 281, jumps directly there, and gets the drawing commands. No searching, no scanning, just instant access.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why PDFs load so quickly even when they're huge files. Your PDF viewer doesn't have to read the whole document.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The trailer\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we have the trailer - think of it as the PDF's \"instruction manual\" that tells your PDF viewer how to get started. When you double-click a PDF file to open it, your PDF reader doesn't start reading from the beginning. Instead, it jumps to the end of the file and reads the trailer first.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the trailer from our sample PDF:\n",
    "\n",
    "```pdf\n",
    "trailer\n",
    "<< /Size 6\n",
    "/Root 1 0 R\n",
    ">>\n",
    "startxref\n",
    "449\n",
    "%%EOF\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's what happens when you open a PDF:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`/Size 6`**: The PDF reader learns there are 6 objects total in the cross-reference table\n",
    "- **`/Root 1 0 R`**: \"Start reading from the catalog object (object 1) to understand the document structure\"\n",
    "- **`startxref 449`**: \"The cross-reference table starts at byte position 449\"\n",
    "- **`%%EOF`**: \"This is truly the end of the file\"\n",
    "\n",
    "So when you open a PDF, here's the process:\n",
    "1. Your PDF reader jumps to the end and reads the trailer\n",
    "2. From the trailer, it gets to know that the xref table is at position 449 and reads it to understand where all objects are\n",
    "3. When you scroll or jump to a page, it uses the xref table to instantly find the right objects\n",
    "\n",
    "This four-part structure (header, body, xref, trailer) is what makes PDFs very fast to read no matter their size."

    "Now, these packages look at the PDF instructions (like the ones shown in the PDL section) and try to reverse-engineer the layout of the document.

A good way to put it is that they have a hard time looking at things a human does.\n",

    "### How does Docling work ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Docling uses a combination of techniques to parse PDF documents effectively:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Text Extraction**: Initially, it extracts text from the PDF using a fast and efficient text extraction engine.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Layout Detection**: It employs a layout detection model to identify different elements on the page, such as titles, text, images, tables, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Table Analysis**: For detected tables, Docling uses a specialized table analysis model to understand the structure and content of the table cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **OCR**: Optionally, one can activate OCR if handling scanned documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Assembly**: Finally, it applies post-processing steps to combine all the extracted information and present it in a structured format in `DoclingDocument`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting object `DoclingDocument` is not a simple text string. It is a hierarchical representation of the original document, containing organized lists of items defined in Docling (`TextItem`, `PictureItem`, etc.). Each of these objects holds its content, coordinates, type, and relationships to other elements.\n",
    "\n",
