    "# 1. A quick recap on HNSW\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you’re querying a vector DB with a query embedding `q`. An easy way to find the nearest neighbors is **exhaustive search**: compute the similarity between `q` and all the stored vectors, then take the top k results. That gives exact results but it scales linearly. With N items in your vector DB, you perform `O(N)` distance evaluations per query. This works great for small datasets but the latency grows rapidly once you start dealing with bigger datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "A more realistic way to think about it: imagine you live in a world with no internet and you’re trying to find the best restaurant in an entire country. You wouldn’t inspect every street and every menu. Instead, you’d use a *navigation strategy*, maybe:\n",
    "- You'll start by choosing a city that is known for its good restaurants\n",
    "- Then you'll ask locals and head to likely part of town\n",
    "- Once in there, you'll ask locals again to go to the right neighborhood\n",
    "- Finally, you'll only compare restaurants in that neighborhood\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the day, you are trading a tiny risk of missing the absolute best restaurant in the country for a massive speedup.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN)** algorithms formalize this trade-off for vector search. In practice, many vector databases use **HNSW** (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) as their default ANN index. HNSW builds a graph that lets the query “walk” toward closer and closer candidates without scanning everything. "

    "## How does it work?\n",
    "\n",
    "Think back to the “no internet” restaurant problem from the previous section. You want the best restaurant in an entire country. Doing it exactly would mean visiting every street and reading every menu. HNSW turns your \"ask the locals\" strategy into reality.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "Your dataset is the country. Each item (vector) is a restaurant somewhere on the map. Your query vector is your personal taste.\n",
    "\n",
    "HNSW pre-builds “local recommendations”: each restaurant knows a handful of nearby restaurants (nearby in embedding space). At query time, you hop from one promising candidate to the next until you’re in the right neighborhood, then you refine the shortlist.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Under the hood\n",
    "\n",
    "HNSW stores a graph:\n",
    "\n",
    "- each vector is a node\n",
    "- each node connects to a small set of nearby nodes (neighbors), where *nearby* is defined by your similarity metric (often cosine)\n",
    "\n",
    "At query time, the search looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start from the index’s entry point (a specific node stored in the HNSW structure).\n",
    "2. Keep a *shortlist* of the best candidates you’ve seen so far.\n",
    "3. Repeatedly expand the most promising candidate by checking its neighbors and updating the shortlist.\n",
    "4. Stop when your budget is exhausted and return the top $K$ from the shortlist.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key knob at query time is `ef` (Qdrant: `hnsw_ef`) which determines **how wide that shortlist is allowed to be.** Bigger `ef` means you consider more alternatives (better recall) but do more distance checks (higher latency).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a table of the 3 main parameters for HNWS graph and their impact on the usability:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Parameter | When | What it controls | Bigger means… |\n",
    "|---|---|---|---|\n",
    "| `M` | build time | max neighbors per node | higher memory, often better connectivity/recall |\n",
    "| `ef_construction` | build time | how hard the builder tries to find good edges | slower build, higher index quality |\n",
    "| `ef` / `hnsw_ef` | query time | how wide the candidate shortlist is | higher latency, higher recall |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why the hierarchy matters\n",
    "\n",
    "The strategy above works on a single graph, but it can waste time wandering before it reaches the right region.\n",
    "\n",
    "HNSW adds the *pick the right city first* step by using multiple layers for search.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The higher layer is like a very coarse-grained map of the country, including details just about very few restaurant that are very far from each other.\n",
    "- The lowest layer of all is like the map of the whole country with all the details. It includes all the nodes of all previous layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "- upper layers contain fewer nodes with longer-range connections\n",
    "- lower layers contain more nodes with short-range connections\n",
    "\n",
    "When searching for the most similar nodes to your query, search is top-down.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You start in the top layer, walk greedily to the most similar node you can find until you can’t improve\n",
    "- You drop to the next layer while keeping your current best node as the new starting point\n",
    "- You repeat until the bottom layer (which contains all nodes)\n",
    "\n",
    "The hierarchy is what makes the navigation both fast and surprisingly accurate.\n",

One caveat: percolation theory assumes **random** node removal. When filter values correlate with embedding position (e.g., all products of one brand cluster together), removal is *spatially correlated* — you lose entire neighborhoods at once, which is far more destructive than the random case. The percolation thresholds in that post are optimistic for correlated filters."

If instead one brand only made luxury laptops and the other only budget wireless earbuds, their products would land in **different regions** of the embedding space and there would be very few or no similarity edges between them. In that case, after filtering, the search starts in one brand's cluster and never reaches the other. That's the pre-filtering failure mode all over again, just at a smaller scale.\n",

    "**Keep this in mind:** Filterable HNSW guarantees that **all Apple products stay connected** and **all Google products stay connected**. It does **not** guarantee that Apple products can reach Google products, this really depends on whether similarity edges bridge the gap, which depends on how correlated brand identity is with embedding position.\n",

    "\n",
    "At query time, Qdrant estimates **filter selectivity** and decides: *should I traverse this graph, or just brute-force?*\n",
    "\n",
    "- **High or medium selectivity**: In this case, Qdrant just traverses the graph. The subgraph edges are always there and whether they're *critical* depends on how many nodes the filter removes. \n",
    " - With high selectivity (e.g, 70% match), most similarity edges still lead to valid nodes\n",
    " - With medium selectivity (e.g, 15% match), the subgraph edges become essential for maintaining connectivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Low selectivity (e.g, 0.1%)**: Qdrant skips the graph entirely. When only a tiny fraction of nodes match, brute-force scanning over the filtered set is faster than graph traversal.\n",
    "\n",
    "The intuition: graph-based search only pays off when there's enough connectivity to navigate. For very selective filters, there's so little data left that exhaustive search wins.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Getting it right in practice with Qdrant\n",
    "\n",
    "Two implementation details trip people up consistently.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Create payload indexes explicitly\n",
    "\n",
    "Qdrant does not automatically index payload fields. Filtering still works without indexes — you'll get correct results — but you lose two critical optimizations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **No subgraph edges**: The HNSW graph won't have the extra edges needed for filtered search, so you lose the connectivity guarantees described above.\n",
    "2. **Poor cardinality estimation**: The query planner can't accurately estimate how many points match the filter, leading to suboptimal search strategies. I couldn't find the exact way it determines the strategy in the documentation but as they're also an open-source package, the curious minds can dive into their package to get this information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Create indexes before uploading data\n",
    "\n",
    "The order matters. HNSW graphs only get the subgraph edges when they're built *after* the payload index exists. If you upload data first, the HNSW graph gets built without them.\n",
    "\n",

    "## What about numerical filters?\n",
    "\n",
    "Everything above focused on categorical filters like `brand IN ('Apple', 'Google')`. But applications also filter on prices, ratings, timestamps, and other continuous values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Qdrant supports three numerical index types: `integer`, `float` & `datetime`\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Qdrant handles numerical ranges\n",
    "\n",
    "The [original filterable HNSW article](https://qdrant.tech/articles/filterable-hnsw/) explains the approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"Numerical range case can be reduced to the previous one if we split numerical range into buckets containing equal amount of points. Next we also connect neighboring buckets to achieve graph connectivity.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how the mechanism works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Buckets contain equal amounts of points** . If you have 10,000 products and 10 buckets, each bucket contains ~1,000 products regardless of how prices are distributed.\n",
    "2. **Neighboring buckets are connected** so range queries like products whose price in [150, 350]can traverse across boundaries.\n",
    "3. **Border filtering is required**: items in boundary buckets that don't match the actual filter need post-filtering. For example, with a `price < 150` filter, if bucket boundaries fall at $0, $100, $200, etc., the query would:\n",
    " - Traverse all buckets up to the one containing $150\n",
    " - Post-filter items in the boundary bucket to exclude those with price >= $150\n",
    "\n",
    "This works well in practice but isn't as clean as the solution for categorical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "And of course, you can always opt for bucketing the numerical filter data yourself as you might have a better knowledge of the data and of where the boundaries should go."
