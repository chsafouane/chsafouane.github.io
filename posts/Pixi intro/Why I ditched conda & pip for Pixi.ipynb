    "## Pixi's toolset\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, Pixi is many things but I'll focus on the things that will be of use to you as a python developer\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pixi is a package manager that can manage packages from both Conda & PyPI. The dependency resolution tools used by Pixi (`resolvo` for conda & uv resolution tool for PyPI packages) are very fast.\n",
    "- Pixi manages environments (similar to `venv` for `pip` users, a feature that is built into `conda`)\n",
    "- Pixi manages `python` version as well (similar to `pyenv` if you use `pip`, built into `conda`)\n",
    "- Pixi has a lock file that allows you to reproduce excatly the same environment (similar to what you'd get `conda-lock` or `pip-lock`)\n",
    "- Pixi can be used as a task-runner, just like `make` or `just`.\n",
    "- Pixi has built-in cross-platform reproducibility. The lock file includes the exact versions and dependencies in all targeted platforms. You can pick and choose the targeted platform by your project (Linux, Windows, etc).\n",
    "- Pixi can also install tools like `brew` and you can have access to the globally.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, while `mamba` is fast, in my experience, `pixi` is faster. `mamba` also lacks lock-files that are essential for reproducibility and a task runner that comes very handy in many situations (CI/CD, Other people running your project, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pixi's project philosophy\n",
    "\n",
    "While `conda` is environment-centric, `pixi` is all about projects. When you init a pixi project, it will create a `pixi.toml` (or a `pyproject.toml` instead if you want). In this file, you can specify many environments that can be composed of different features. For example, you can have:\n",
    "- a base feature that includes the basic packages needed by your project\n",
    "- a run feature that consists of packages needed for only running the project\n",
    "- a test feature that consists of additional packages needed for testing the project\n",
    "- a build feature that consists of additional packages or tools needed for building the project. \n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine having to train a model on a GPU but then when running it, to only have a CPU at your disposal. What you would do is have:\n",
    "- A training environment composed of the features `base` + `build` + `test` that will include the base packages, some CUDA dependencies and pytorch with GPU support coming from the build feature, and test packages like `pytest` coming from the test feature.\n",
    "- A CI/CD environment composed of `base` + `run` + `test`. The only difference this time is that you'll be using the run feature that include `pytorch-cpu` and no CUDA dependencies.\n",
    "- A run environment composed only of `base` + `run` features.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other nice thing is that you can say that you can enforce that some environments (or all of them) use the same versions of the common packages."
