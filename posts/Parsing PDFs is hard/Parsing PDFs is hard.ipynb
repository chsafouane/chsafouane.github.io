    "Lately, I've been working on a project with a customer where the goal is to extract some specific information from PDF documents. To my big surprise, this task has proven to be quite challenging.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main challenges stem from the following elements:\n",
    "- **Privacy concerns:** using an external API to parse the PDFs was a no-go as the PDFs contained sensitive information.\n",
    "- **Complexity of the documents:** the PDFs at hand contained a mix of text, complex tables, math formulas, all of which needed to be processed and understood in context.\n",
    "- **Absence of a clear structure:** the lack of consistent formatting and structure across the documents made it difficult to apply standard parsing across the board.\n",
