    "I've been deploying LLM-powered systems in production in many companies and across different industries for almost 3 years now. Each time, I encountered the same critical challenge: **how do you truly evaluate whether your LLM is performing well and not only rely on vibe checks ?**\n",

    "Here's a common scenario I've encountered many times: a company builds a RAG system over their product documentation, and naturally wants to evaluate and improve it. But there's a pattern I keep seeing so often, companies expecting AI to \"just work\" out of the box.\n",
    "\n",
    "This expectation shows up most clearly in evaluation practices. Companies often use \"vibe checks\" by manually asking a dozen of questions and eyeballing whether the system answers seem reasonable.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a terrible way to evaluate your LLM applications for multiple reasons:\n",
    "- The queries you're going to ask are biased towards what you think the system should be able to do or towards a specific range of queries that you expect the final user to enter. You will likely miss most of the cases and failure modes that you didn't think about.\n",
    "From first-hand experience, the users usually will surprise you with the way they write their queries and the types of queries they will enter. You should expect them to write them as if they are in a rush 😅\n",
    "\n",
    "- Not having evaluating your app in a systematic and/or scalable way will lead to have to deal with \"whack-a-mole\" situation (as Hamel so beautifully puts it) where you fix one by changing some prompt only to have another one pop up somewhere else.\n",
    "This will lead to frustration from your stakeholders, frustration from the team working on the app, and maybe even to a a lack of trust in LLMs whithin your organization.\n",
