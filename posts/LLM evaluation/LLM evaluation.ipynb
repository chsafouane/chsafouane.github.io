    "\n",
    "Once you develop your LLM-powered app, you are faced with **\"Which comes first, the chicken or the egg?\"** dilemma:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You don't have real user queries data because you haven't deployed you app yet\n",
    "- You can't deploy your app yet because you haven't tested it with real user queries yet\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sub-lesson 1: Real data is better than synthetic data\n",
    "\n",
    "You can almost always get some pseudo-real data. If you can't have access to some beta users, ask your teammates to test the system. They will have very probably some biases of their own, but at least you will get some data that is not completely synthetic and that has different characteristics because it's coming from different people.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sub-lesson 2: The bad way to create synthetic data\n",
    "Real data is always better than synthetic data. But hey, if you really can't have some real data, then synthetic data is the way to go.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mistake most people do when creating synthetic data is to ask an LLM to generate queries that are similar to what they expect the users to enter. This is a also a bad idea as the generated queries will be biased towards what you think the users will enter and will likely miss many failure modes.\n",
    "Most importantly, the generated queries will likely be \"too good\" and not representative of real user queries (messy, mispellings, incomplete...).\n",
    "\n",
    "I've trained a retriever in the past on synthetic data generated this way. While the performance on synthetic-queries-like was really good, the performance on real user queries was really bad. The gap between synthetic data and real user data was just too big.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sub-lesson 3: The good way to create synthetic data\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Think of dimensions of variability of user queries:*\n",
    "An approach that I have learnt from Hamel Husain & Shreya Shankar is to first think about the different dimensions of variability in user queries for your specific application.\n",
    "For example, if you're building a RAG over a technical product documentation, you can think about several dimensions of variability, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- User type (user, admin, developer, etc.)\n",
    "- Intent (seeking information, troubleshooting, feature requests, etc.)\n",
    "- User expertise level (beginner, intermediate, expert, etc.)\n",
    "- Query length (short queries, long queries, etc.)\n",
    "- Query complexity (simple queries, complex queries with multiple sub-questions, etc.)\n",
    "- Query style (formal, informal, typos, etc.)\n",
    "- etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a query always depends on the context of the application and the persona of the users (a wink 😉 to the pre-lesson above), a dimension should be really specific to your application and not some general dimensions that someone else has used in another context.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, for each dimension, you can brainstorm different values that the dimension can take (or delegate the task of brainstorming values of some dimensions to an LLM). For example, for the \"user expertise level\" dimension, you can have the values: \"beginner\", \"intermediate\", \"expert\" as shown above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the list of dimensions and their possible values is ready, you can start combining them to create tuples that will represent different synthetic queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some examples of tuples representing combinations of the dimensions mentioned above.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "(\"end_user\", \"troubleshoot\", \"beginner\", \"short\", \"simple\", \"typos\")\n",
    "(\"developer\", \"integration_info\", \"expert\", \"long\", \"complex\", \"formal\")\n",
    "(\"admin\", \"permissions_help\", \"intermediate\", \"short\", \"simple\", \"informal\")\n",
    "(\"end_user\", \"feature_discovery\", \"beginner\", \"short\", \"simple\", \"incomplete\")\n",
    "(\"support_engineer\", \"root_cause_analysis\", \"expert\", \"long\", \"complex\", \"dense\")\n",
    "(\"end_user\", \"account_status\", \"beginner\", \"short\", \"simple\", \"mixed_case\")\n",
    "(\"developer\", \"performance_optimization\", \"expert\", \"medium\", \"complex\", \"typos\")\n",
    "(\"admin\", \"audit_logging\", \"intermediate\", \"medium\", \"moderate\", \"formal\")\n",
    "(\"end_user\", \"error_meaning\", \"beginner\", \"short\", \"simple\", \"abbreviations\")\n",

    "# Lesson 3: Have a systematic way to identify failure modes\n",
    "\n",
    "When you start evaluating your LLM applications, you need to have a systematic way to identify failure modes. Not having a systematic way to identify failure modes will lead you to the same \"whack-a-mole\" situation mentioned earlier where you fix one failure mode only to have another one pop up somewhere else.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can identify failure modes using synthetic data (created as explained in Lesson 2) or real user queries (if you have access to them) even before deploying your app in production.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sub-lesson 1: The three steps for error analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, the steps are:\n",
    "- Generate your system's anwsers for the queries that you have (real or synthetic). Gather the traces of the execution for each query.\n",
    "- Open-coding: Note down the first failure that appears in the trace for each query (if present)\n",
    "- Axial coding: Cluster the failures into families of failure modes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This three steps are the key to a successful error analysis. Since I've discovered this approach in Hamel & Shreya's course, it has become my go-to approach for identifying failure modes in LLM applications in a systematic way.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Traces are king\n",
    "\n",
    "A trace is a detailed log of the execution of your LLM application for a query. It includes all the intermediate steps, LLM calls, tool calls, and final output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, now that you have a set of user queries (either real or synthetic), input each query through your LLM application and generate the whole trace of the execution. The trace should include all the intermediate steps, LLM calls, tool calls, and final output.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should go through a good number of queries to cover the diversity of your queries (usually around a 100 but really depends on the complexity of your application and the diversity of your user queries, could be more or could be less than a 100).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Open-coding\n",
    "Once you have the traces, go through each trace one by one and note down the first failure that appears in the trace for each query (if present). The description of the failure should be a bit specific. For example, you can say \"Didn't call the `call_customer_tool` even though the customer asked the system to do so\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### Axial coding\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you have annoatated the failures in your dataset, the next step is to put them into clusters of failure modes. You can do:\n",
    "- this manually by going through the list of failures and grouping them into families of failure modes\n",
    "- using an LLM to help you with the clustering. You can provide the LLM with the list of failures and ask it to group them into families of failure modes. This is usually my starting point as it saves a lot of time. Then, I go through the clusters and refine them if needed.\n",
    "\n",

    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### What comes next ?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prioritization:** Now having these clusters of failure modes will help you identify which exact parts of your system are responsible for failures and will help quantify how many failures are due to each failure mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Iteration:** Once you have identified the failure modes and prioritized them, you can start working on fixing them. After fixing them, you can go through the same process again to identify new failure modes that are still there.\n",
    "It's very important to know that error analysis is an iterative process. You need to do it two or three times at first.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scale your evals in production\n",
    "\n",
    "You might ask yourself if you'll be doing this manually over production data to verify if th? The answer is that once you have a good understanding of the failure modes and have fixed the most critical ones, you can scale your evaluation by running a custom LLM-as-a-judge for large samples of queries that you have in prod.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how to do it:\n",
    "- Get the traces that you've labeled previously with successful and failed queries & split them into a train, a dev and a test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a custom LLM-as-a-judge for each failure mode:\n",
    "  - For each failure mode, create a prompt that describes the failure mode in a very specific way. Don't be broad in your description and don't use vague word (like good, etc). and provides examples of successful and failed queries from your labeled dataset.\n",
    "  - Provide the LLM with example of both successful and failed queries from your train dataset to help it understand the failure mode better.\n",
    "  - Eval the performance of the LLM-as-a-judge on your dev set and iterate on the prompt until you reach a satisfactory performance\n",
    "  - Once you're satisfied with the performance on the dev set, test the LLM-as-a-judge on your test set to get an estimate of its performance on unseen data. This should give you a good idea of how well the LLM-as-a-judge will perform on production data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, this LLM-as-a-judge can be used to evaluate large samples of production queries and identify the failure modes that are still present in your system.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sub-lesson 2: Clustering production queries didn't work for me\n",
    "\n",
    "One approach that I've tested in the past (amounts to 1 year) and that didn't work that well for me is to identify a set of classes that I expect user queries in my app to fall into. Identifying the classes helps in knowing which queries the model is not handling well and which classes of queries need more attention.\n",
    "\n",
    "On top of the identified classes, I would create a category for \"other\" queries that don't fall into any of the identified classes.\n",
    "an analysis of the queries that have fallen into the \"other\" category helped me identify new classes that I hadn't thought about initially and better pinpoint the analysis of the performance of the model on different types of queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the time, I used GPT-4 to do the classification. What didn't work well for me was most queries ended up in the \"other\" category, defeating the purpose of the classification. This pattern showed up with a couple of other decoder LLMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "While I thought about finetuning a Bert-like model to do the classification, having to finetune a new model whenever a new class is identified seemed like an overkill and a maintenance nightmare."

While these metrics can be useful, the prompt used in them is generic and not at all tailored to your specific application and its requirements. Think of LLM-as-a-judge for a second. Usually, you would want the judge to have ample context about your application and the specific criterion you want to evaluate. A generic prompt won't cut it at all. The same goes for the metrics that are LLM-based.\n",
    "  \n",
